# WSD-2015
Web Development Course at  Aalto University which teaches front end and back end. This directory contains exercises from the web development course in the previous semester.

Currently I am working on a project with two other group members to create a website , where developers can post their games based on java script .On the other hand , the users can play those games, after the registeration. Code cannot be posted over here , since the course is in progress


**Front End Technologies**

Javascript, jquery , HTML , CSS

**Back End Technologies**

Django


**Project**


Currently the project is running on heroku. Please check the following link. It will take some time.(refresh two/three times)
* http://vast-escarpment-5866.herokuapp.com/
* Username : Test  
* Password : foobar

If it doesnt works , probably we have shifted to another domain name.(heroku works like this)
