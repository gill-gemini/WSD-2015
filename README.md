# WSD-2015
Web Development Course at  Aalto University which teaches front end and back end. This directory contains exercises from the web development course in the previous semester.

Currently I am working on a project with two other group members to create a website , where developers can post their games based on java script .On the other hand , the users can play those games, after the registeration. Code cannot be posted over here , since the course is in progress
